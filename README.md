Custom Little-Endian UART implementation to learn Verilog. Main goals are to be able to understand basic hardware implementation of these protocols for future projects.
In this project, I use Verilog as my hardware description language and python for testbenching (through the cocotb framework). All the tests are included in this repository for those interested. The nix is used to set up a virtual environment for python on NixOS, my development environment. Other platforms should be able to exclude it. This
implementation uses a "majority oversampling" system, where every bit will be sampled x times (where x is an input wire to the rx module) and the majority of 1's or 0's detected will become the bit that gets inserted. This allows for robust error correction where a tick based transfer may potentially introduce errors.
