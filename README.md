Custom UART implementation to learn Verilog. Main goals are to be able to understand basic hardware implementation of these protocols for future projects.
In this project, I use Verilog as my hardware description language and python for testbenching (through the cocotb framework). All the tests are included in this repository for those interested. The nix is used to set up a virtual environment for python on NixOS, my development environment. Other platforms should be able to exclude it. My next goal is to add oversampling implementation, as it currently just transfers once piece of data every tick.
